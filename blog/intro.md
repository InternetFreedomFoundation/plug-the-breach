[Data breaches are on the rise around the world](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY), even more dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. A shift to remote working has led to an increase in data breach costs as well. As organisations shift their critical functions to the cloud and dependence on the digital increases, the potential threats to our data becomes more pronounced. In that context, Internet Freedom Foundation’s upcoming initiative, PlugTheBreach, aims to cover, report and track data breaches in India to increase transparency and public awareness.

The economic impact of data breaches is also tremendous. As per an [IBM Report](https://in.newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic?lnk=hm), released in 2021, data breaches globally now cost companies $4.24 million per incident on average. It also reported ₹165 million as the average total cost of a data breach in the 2021 study, an increase of 17.85% from 2020. Further, the per-unit data cost increased by 6.85% to Rs 5,900. As per the aforementioned report, the average time to detect a breach went up from 230 days to 239 days, while the average time to contain a breach went down from 83 to 81 days. This indicates a significant amount of information and data loss for users.

The importance of cyber security researchers is further underlined by the increase in data breaches and security incidents. Research conducted by [Micro Focus](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/home) shows that Indian organisations have seen a 58.2% increase in the volume of cyberthreats. Moreover, February 2021 [witnessed](https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/india-becomes-favourite-destination-for-cyber-criminals-amid-covid-19-121040501218_1.html) a mammoth 9.04 million brute force attacks, compared to 1.3 million in February 2020. The study by Micro Focus also shows that 98% of Indian organisations have a [shortage](https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/98-of-organizations-in-india-have-no-cyber-security-staff-652591) of IT Security Personnel, in violation of applicable law. As the COVID-19 pandemic causes more aspects of modern life to go digital, the threat, and indeed incidence, of such attacks will only rise further.

A [data breach](https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/data-breach/) is a security incident in which confidential, sensitive and protected information such as medical records, financial information or personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed to unauthorised persons. As a result of data breaches, data of users is available to any third party over the internet for nefarious use. The [table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yc3yRISxdVx_HYI2cZ9CjjdeYhdo_8LCNgsSfM8DItw/edit) below, which is based on publicly available information, illustrates the frequency, scale and threat posed by data breaches.

With rising incidents of data breaches, a disturbing trend is emerging wherein most organisations are becoming reluctant to declare the breach as well as the financial and information loss borne by the organisation. Such practices can have damaging consequences as failure to acknowledge and report the breach on a timely basis may prevent individuals from taking actions to protect their identities. In this context, the directions by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its decision in Binoy Viswam v. Union of India [2017 SCC OnLine SC 647 at Para 126(iii)] serve as a reminder of the positive obligation to maintain data security when it stated that:

_“It is also necessary to highlight that a large section of citizens feel concerned about possible data leak….It is important that the aforesaid apprehensions are assuaged by taking proper measures so that confidence is instilled among the public at large that there is no chance of unauthorised leakage of data whether it is done by tightening the operations of the contractors who are given the job of enrollment, they being private persons or by prescribing severe penalties to those who are found guilty of leaking the details….”_

Our broader recommendation is for a comprehensive and focussed push towards improving cyber security by encouraging Indian security researchers. Moreover, on the discovery and closure of the vulnerability a public statement should also follow by CERT-In in addition to a specific notification to each affected person on how it may impact them and what steps they should take to mitigate harm.
