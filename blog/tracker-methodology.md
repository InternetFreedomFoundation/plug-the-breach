## About the Project

The main purpose of PlugTheBreach aims to improve transparency with regards to increasing incidence of data breaches in India by providing a comprehensive database of breaches that occur. Our long-term vision for the project involves two phase:

1.  **Phase 1:** Setting up the tracker using publicly available resources
2.  **Phase 2:** Creating a website for reporting live data breaches

## How will we collect data?

As has been reported earlier, in many cases, companies even go after researchers who bring to light incidents of security breaches. Cybersecurity researchers in India have long faced threats for their work. Previously, there was the case of journalist [Dissent Doe, who was sued for disclosing a leak in client data](https://internetfreedom.in/security-researchers-need-legislative-protection-from-vexatious-lawsuits/). A more recent incident is the case of the [Mobikwik data breach earlier in March, 2021](https://internetfreedom.in/mobikwik-data-breach/), in which Mobikwik [threatened](https://twitter.com/MobiKwik/status/1367489330902675463) to take legal action against the security researcher who uncovered the breach and suggested that the researcher was ‘_trying to grab media attention_’.

During phase 1 of the project, we will rely solely on publicly available reports to populate our breach database with weekly updates. While this will primarily include news reports, we may also include verified information that is scraped from social media. The basis for adopting such an approach that focuses on publicly available reports is the aforementioned reluctance of Indian entities to acknowledge vulnerabilities or breaches in their information management systems.

Phase 2 of the project, we will create a website called "PlugTheBreach" which will make the tracker publicly available. Work on phase 1 will continue simultaneously as the breaches will be updated and populated on the tracker in the back-end.

## Why this initiative?

The key problem here, and indeed, something that is part of the _raison d'etre_ of this project, is the lack of transparency, which results in a near complete lack of information. In most cases, companies fail to even acknowledge these breaches. A data breach exposes confidential, sensitive and protected information to unauthorised persons. As a result of these breaches, data of Indian users is available to any third party
over the internet for nefarious use. Thus, with this tracker, we hope to increase transparency and accountability around these data breaches.
